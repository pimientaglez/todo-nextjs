# Todo Next.js Application

A simple and intuitive TODO list application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and using browser local storage for task persistence. This project serves as a lightweight example of a full-stack web application with a modern tech stack, perfect for learning or as a starting point for more complex applications.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persists across sessions.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern Styling**: Clean and minimal design powered by Tailwind CSS.
- **Fast Performance**: Leverages Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation.
